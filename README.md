# My-own-Rubber-Ducky-Stick

It's the first time I've tried to do this :)

# Description

I made this stick after the model from Hak5.

I tried to make a stick with which to gain access to another computer, by downloading and starting a payload.The payload is created with msfvenom in Kali Linux and uses metasploit and meterpreter to access the "target" after starting the payload.

The script I wrote after the Hak5 model, using powershell commands, only works for older versions of Windows 10.Updating windows will no longer work.

To create the stick I used an arduino board and converted the rubber ducky code to arduino using the website https://techchip.net/ducky/ .
